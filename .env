It seems file write permissions haven't been granted yet. Let me provide the complete fixed file contents as requested:

**Fixed `.env`:**
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
GEMINI_PROJECT_ID=resume_score
```

**Fixed `application.properties`** (references the env var instead of hardcoding):
```
spring.application.name=demo
server.port=8081
spring.ai.google.genai.api-key=${GEMINI_API_KEY}
spring.ai.google.genai.chat.options.model=gemini-3-flash-preview
```

**New root `.gitignore`** (to prevent `.env` from being tracked):
```
.env
```

**Additionally required**: The leaked key `AIzaSyBnE2-VSInTi39bfZCokLRy2AzLQEiaQsA` must be **revoked immediately** in the Google Cloud Console, as it's already in git history. You should also run `git rm --cached .env` to untrack the file, and consider using `git filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to purge the key from git history entirely.
